## About The Project
***
### Project Description
- Scikit - Learn
    - A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library. 
    - Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms.
- Scipy Stats
    - A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats. 
    - An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. Find a data set on which it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensure the assumptions underlying ANOVA are met, and then perform and display the results of your ANOVA using scipy.stats.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
***
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### **Prerequisites**

The libraries and packages that need to be installed for running this code are shown in requirements.txt, you will also need to either have access to anaconda/python in another form to work on the actual file, access to a web browser where you can work on your own copy of the version using binder. This will not update/save the notebook unless you copy the code down. You can also look at a rendered view of the notebook by clicking the badges in the follwoing links. [Scikit-Learn.ipynb](https://github.com/colmhiggs11/Machine_Learning_21_CH/blob/main/Scikit-Learn.ipynb) , [Scipy_Stats.ipynb](https://github.com/colmhiggs11/Machine_Learning_21_CH/blob/main/Scipy_Stats.ipynb).


### **Installation**

1. If you have anaconda installed, go to the command line and complete step 2.
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/colmhiggs11/Machine_Learning_21_CH.git
   ```
3. Open Jupyter lab
   ```sh
   jupyter lab
   ```
4. This will open the Jupyter Notebookin the browser. From here ensure all of the items in the requirments.txt file are installed. If any of them are missing or need to be updated use the following command.
   ```sh
   pip install-r requirements.txt 
   ```

The Scikit-Learn notebook as mentioned above can be cloned and opened up through Jupyter Lab & python users. For users that do not have access to python/jupyter lab a rendered view can be found by clicking on the nbviewer badge. A rendered version can be access and launched by clicking on the binder badge. This notebook analyses the SciKit learn and three algorithms that are used in machine learning. We follow the steps lined out in the machine learning process flow below.

|:--:| 
| *Iris flowers by species & measurements included in Fishers Dataset* |

<div align="left">

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from [UCI archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). There were two errors which required updating the .csv file.
    
    This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ).
    The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample:
    4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.

### 3.4 What the code does
The two main file that will provide the outputs for the analysis are *[iris_functs.py](https://github.com/colmhiggs11/ProandS_Project/blob/master/iris_functs.py)* and *[2.analysis.py](https://github.com/colmhiggs11/ProandS_Project/blob/master/2.analysis.py)*.

**Importing Functions and list** - The functions created above were imported and the list assigned to variable heading also imported so that both cold be called for execution. (*Shown below*)

    import iris_functs as ifs
    from iris_functs import heading,Data

**Calling functions** - Each of the functions were then called. Some required using the list **"heading"** to be passed through as the argument. (*Shown below*)


## 4. Analysis of Data
### 4.1 Summary.txt
The summary table below shows the output that can be found in the [summary.txt](https://github.com/colmhiggs11/ProandS_Project/blob/master/summary.txt) file using the describe() function that was executed on per species type of Iris flower. The values for each summary metric are discussed below the table.

#### Count
All values clearly show that measurements were taken on 50 flowers in each of the three species.

---
#### Mean
Shows the average measurements taken for each of the flower types.

## 5. Summary / Conclusions
Taking all of the data into account it is clear to see that the setosa flower is linearly separable from the virginica and versicolor flowers. To differentiate between the two latter flowers takes a lot more time and research has shown that with Machine learning programs the probability of being able to determine which species you are dealing with can be completed with a relatively high degree of accuracy. Setosa flowers have a much smaller petal width and petal length than the other two, and while their sepal length is on the smaller side but similar to that of Virginicas and Versicolors, Setosa's sepal width is typically  larger than its rival species. To differentiate between Virginica's and Versicolors you need to look at data and relationships side by side. Although Virginica's typically have a larger petal length and petal width, there is more of a correlation between those two when looking at Versicolors.
